    "Exchange 1: Checking for Missing Values in a CSV Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "    You shared a CSV dataset link, and I provided Python code to check for missing values in the dataset using pandas. The code reads the CSV file from the URL and uses isnull().sum() to calculate missing values in each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exchange 2: Counting Rows and Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "    You asked how to count rows and columns in the dataset using Python. I explained that by using pandas, you could load the dataset and check the dimensions with df.shape, which returns the number of rows and columns as a tuple.\n",
    "    You also asked for clarification on the terms \"observations\" and \"variables.\" I explained that observations correspond to rows in the dataset (individual villagers), and variables correspond to columns (characteristics of the villagers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Exchange 3: Summarizing Columns in a Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "    You asked how to generate summaries of the dataset's columns. I provided Python code that uses info(), describe(), and value_counts() to display information about numeric and non-numeric columns. These methods give overviews like data types, summary statistics, and the frequency of unique values in specific columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exchange 4: Titanic Dataset Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "    You requested an example using a Titanic dataset. I provided code to load the Titanic dataset, obtain its shape using df.shape, and generate summary statistics with df.describe().\n",
    "\n",
    "Exchange 5: Attributes vs Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "    You asked about the difference between an attribute (like df.shape) and a method (like df.describe()). I explained that an attribute stores a value or property of the object and doesn't require parentheses, while a method is a function that performs an action and is invoked with parentheses, optionally containing arguments.\n",

    "4. We discussed the df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe() function, explaining its purpose and how it differs from df.describe().\n",
    "5. Throughout our discussion, we emphasized the importance of understanding how these methods affect data retention and the insights they can provide in exploratory data analysis.\n",

    "A use case for preferring del df['col'] could be when a specific column has a high percentage of missing values and isn't crucial for your analysis. For example, the 'deck' column in the Titanic dataset has many missing values and I don't consider it essential for some analysis or model that I am creating. I could delete this column entirely rather than losing a large portion of the dataset by dropping incomplete rows.\n",

    "The importance of using df['col'] before df.dropna(), is that if you are planning to delete a column, but you delete all the 'incomplete' rows first, those rows might have only been incomplete because of the column you were planning to drop. By removing columns with many missing values first, you reduce the number of rows that will be dropped due to missing data in the remaining columns. This helps maximize data retention. For example, for the titanic dataset, if you remove the embark_town column you will lose a lot of good data, while removing the column would be more benificial.\n",
