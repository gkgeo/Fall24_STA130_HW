    "### Variables and Exploration Plan\n",
    "- Outcome: `LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_score` (3-9 scale) - chosen to measure social isolation\n",
    "- Predictor: `CONNECTION_activities_visited_family_p3m` - key indicator of family connection\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization: Boxplot of loneliness scores across visit frequencies\n",
    "- Appropriate because it shows distribution of continuous outcome across categories and highlights central tendency and spread\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Method\n",
    "Hypothesis test comparing mean loneliness between frequent (weekly or more) vs infrequent (monthly or less) visitors, with a confidence interval for the difference in means. A hypothesis test comparing means is chosen because we're comparing a numeric outcome (loneliness score) between two distinct groups of visitors, making it the most direct way to assess if visit frequency affects loneliness levels.\n",

    "H0: No difference in mean loneliness between frequent and infrequent visitors\n",
    "\n",
    "Ha: Frequent visitors have lower mean loneliness scores\n",
    "\n",
    "Expect frequent visitors to show 1-2 points lower average loneliness. Finding a clear difference would provide strong evidence that regular family visits help reduce loneliness - a simple but powerful message for social media campaigns encouraging family connection. Will relate findings back to real-world impact by discussing what a 1-2 point difference means in daily life."
