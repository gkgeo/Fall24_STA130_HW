    "2. Interpretation of p-values:\n",
    "   - Smaller p-values indicate stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "   - They suggest that our observed data is unlikely if the null hypothesis were true.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sampling distributions and test statistics:\n",
    "   - The sampling distribution shows the expected spread of a statistic if we repeated our experiment many times under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "   - Our observed test statistic is compared to this distribution to assess how unusual our result is.\n",

    "4. Simulation methods:\n",
    "   - We examined code for simulating p-values in the context of a study on kissing couples' head-tilting preferences.\n",
    "   - This demonstrated how to practically apply these concepts to real-world data.\n",

    "5. Interpretation of results:\n",
    "   - We discussed how to categorize the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis based on p-value thresholds.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, let me explain the changes and their implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "The main change is in the calculation of the p-value. Instead of using the absolute difference from 0.5, we now only count simulated statistics that are greater than or equal to the observed statistic.\n",
    "The line p_value_one_sided = (simulated_statistics >= observed_statistic).mean() replaces the previous two-sided calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the two-sided test, we were testing if there was any difference between the proportion of improved patients and 0.5 (no effect).\n",
    "In this one-sided test, we're specifically testing if the proportion of improved patients is greater than 0.5.\n",
    "The null hypothesis is now \"The chance the vaccine improves patient health is less than or equal to 50%\".\n",
    "The alternative hypothesis is \"The chance the vaccine improves patient health is greater than 50%\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "P-value expectation:\n",
    "\n",
    "We should expect the p-value in the one-tailed test to be approximately half of the two-tailed p-value, assuming the observed effect is in the direction specified by the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "This is because the one-tailed test concentrates all the rejection region on one side of the distribution, while the two-tailed test splits it between both tails.\n",
    "However, if the observed effect is in the opposite direction of the alternative hypothesis, the one-tailed p-value could be much larger than the two-tailed p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, since we're testing if the vaccine increases the chance of improvement, the one-tailed test is more appropriate if we have a prior reason to believe that vaccination can only increase (not decrease) the chance of improvement. However, if we're open to the possibility that vaccination could either increase or decrease the chance of improvement, a two-tailed test would be more appropriate.\n",
    "The one-tailed test will generally have more power to detect an effect in the hypothesized direction, but at the cost of not being able to detect effects in the opposite direction. The choice between one-tailed and two-tailed tests should be made based on the research question and prior knowledge, not on which gives a smaller p-value."

    "A most beloved piece of [statistical lore](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2012.00620.x) about the (most famous) statistician Ronald Fisher involves cups of tea with milk. Fisher and his friend and colleague, Dr. Muriel Bristol, worked at Cambridge in the 1920s and regularly had tea together. During one of their afternoon tea times, Bristol refused a cup of tea from Fisher because he put milk in first BEFORE pouring in the tea. Bristol said she could taste the difference, and much preferred the taste of tea when the milk was poured in afterward the tea. Fisher didn't think that there could be a difference and proposed a hypothesis test to examine the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher made 8 cups of tea, 4 with milk added in first and 4 with tea added in first, and gave them to Dr. Bristol without her seeing how they were made and she would say if she thought the tea or the milk was poured first. As it turned out, Bristol correctly identified if the tea or milk was poured first for all 8 of the cups. Fisher, being a skeptical statistician wanted to test if this could be happening by chance with Bristol just randomly guessing (or whether there was evidence against an assumption of Bristol just randomly guessing), and subsequently designed a statistical hypothesis test to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you run an experiment like this with students in STA130. You get a random sample of 80 STA130 students to each taste one cup of tea and tell you whether they think the milk or tea was poured first. **Suppose 49 students are able to correctly state which was poured first.** Provide a statistical analysis of this experiment as guided through the following set of questions.\n",

    "Methodology Explanation:\n",
    "1. We use a simulation-based approach to estimate the p-value under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "2. We simulate 10,000 experiments where students are guessing randomly (p = 0.5).\n",
    "3. We calculate the proportion of simulated experiments that show results as extreme as or more extreme than our observed data.\n",
    "4. We also calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true population proportion.\n",
    "5. We create two visualizations:\n",
    "   a) A histogram of the sampling distribution under the null hypothesis\n",
    "   b) A plot showing the observed proportion and its confidence interval relative to the null hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Findings and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Results:\n",
    "- Observed proportion: 0.613\n",
    "- P-value: 0.0298\n",
    "- 95% Confidence Interval: (0.500, 0.713)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Observed Proportion:\n",
    "   The observed proportion of correct guesses is 0.613, meaning 61.3% of the sampled STA130 students correctly identified whether milk or tea was poured first. This is higher than the 50% we would expect if students were guessing randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. P-value:\n",
    "   The p-value of 0.0298 is less than the common significance level of 0.05. This suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis. The p-value represents the probability of observing a result as extreme as or more extreme than our sample data, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Confidence Interval:\n",
    "   The 95% confidence interval (0.500, 0.713) provides a range of plausible values for the true population proportion. Notably, this interval just barely includes 0.5 (the lower bound is exactly 0.500).\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion regarding the Null Hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our analysis, we reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level. There is statistically significant evidence to suggest that STA130 students can identify the pouring order of milk and tea better than random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's crucial to consider some important points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Statistical vs. Practical Significance: While our result is statistically significant (p < 0.05), the practical significance is less clear. The lower bound of the confidence interval (0.500) just touches 0.5, indicating that the true population proportion might be very close to random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Margin of Error: The confidence interval suggests that the true proportion of students who can correctly identify the pouring order could be anywhere from 50.0% to 71.3%. This wide range includes values that are only slightly better than random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Limitations:\n",
    "   - This experiment assumes all other factors are controlled (e.g., temperature of tea, type of milk, etc.).\n",
    "   - The results may not generalize beyond STA130 students.\n",
    "   - The sample size (80) is relatively small, which contributes to the wide confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Comparison to Original Experiment: Unlike Dr. Bristol's perfect score in Fisher's original experiment, our results show a more modest effect. This aligns with our expectation that testing a general population would yield different results than testing a single individual who claimed to have this ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while we have statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis, the practical implications of this result should be interpreted cautiously. The data suggests that STA130 students may have some ability to distinguish the order of pouring, but this ability might be quite limited. The wide confidence interval and the closeness of the lower bound to 0.5 indicate substantial uncertainty in the true proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For future research, we might consider:\n",
    "1. Increasing the sample size to narrow the confidence interval and potentially provide more conclusive results.\n",
    "2. Conducting repeated experiments to see if the results are consistent.\n",
    "3. Investigating factors that might influence a person's ability to distinguish the pouring order, such as tea drinking experience or sensory sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment serves as an interesting modern adaptation of Fisher's classic test, demonstrating both the principles of hypothesis testing and the nuances involved in interpreting statistical results in real-world contexts.\n"

    "### Summary of ChatBot (not using ChatGPT, cannot get a link)\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly! Here's a summary of what we discussed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Code Modification:\n",
    "   We modified the code from Demo II of Week 5 TUT to perform a one-sided (one-tailed) hypothesis test instead of a two-sided test. The main change was in the calculation of the p-value, where we now only consider simulated statistics greater than or equal to the observed statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hypothesis Changes:\n",
    "   - Original null hypothesis (two-sided): \"The chance the vaccine improves patient health is 50%\"\n",
    "   - New null hypothesis (one-sided): \"The chance the vaccine improves patient health is less than or equal to 50%\"\n",
    "   - New alternative hypothesis: \"The chance the vaccine improves patient health is greater than 50%\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interpretation Differences:\n",
    "   - Two-sided test: Looked for any difference from 50% chance of improvement\n",
    "   - One-sided test: Specifically tests if the chance of improvement is greater than 50%\n",
    "\n",
    "4. P-value Expectations:\n",
    "   - If the observed effect is in the hypothesized direction, the one-sided p-value is expected to be about half of the two-sided p-value.\n",
    "   - This is because the rejection region is concentrated on one side of the distribution rather than split between two tails.\n",
    "   - However, if the effect is in the opposite direction, the one-sided p-value could be much larger than the two-sided p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Test Selection Considerations:\n",
    "   - One-sided tests have more power to detect effects in the hypothesized direction.\n",
    "   - However, they cannot detect effects in the opposite direction.\n",
    "   - The choice between one-sided and two-sided tests should be based on the research question and prior knowledge, not on which gives a smaller p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Appropriateness of Test:\n",
    "   - One-sided test is more appropriate if there's a strong prior belief that the effect can only be in one direction.\n",
    "   - Two-sided test is more appropriate if we're open to effects in either direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This change in approach demonstrates how the formulation of hypotheses and the choice of statistical test can impact the interpretation of results in scientific studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly. Here's a summary of our discussion about Fisher's Tea Experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Problem Introduction:\n",
    "   We analyzed a modern adaptation of Ronald Fisher's famous tea-tasting experiment. In our version, 80 STA130 students were tested on their ability to identify whether milk or tea was poured first in a cup.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hypotheses:\n",
    "   - Null Hypothesis (H₀): Students are guessing randomly (p = 0.5)\n",
    "   - Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ): Students can identify the pouring order better than random guessing (p > 0.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Results:\n",
    "   - 49 out of 80 students (61.3%) correctly identified the pouring order\n",
    "   - P-value: 0.0298\n",
    "   - 95% Confidence Interval: (0.500, 0.713)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Analysis:\n",
    "   We used a simulation-based approach to calculate the p-value and confidence interval. The p-value (0.0298) is less than the 0.05 significance level, leading us to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Conclusion:\n",
    "   While there is statistically significant evidence that STA130 students can identify the pouring order better than random guessing, the practical significance is less clear. The confidence interval barely excludes 0.5, indicating that the true ability might be only slightly better than random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Limitations and Considerations:\n",
    "   - The sample size is relatively small, leading to a wide confidence interval\n",
    "   - Results may not generalize beyond STA130 students\n",
    "   - The practical importance of this ability is debatable\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Future Directions:\n",
    "   We suggested potential follow-up studies with larger sample sizes or investigations into factors that might influence this ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment demonstrates the principles of hypothesis testing while highlighting the nuances of interpreting statistical results in real-world contexts.\n"
